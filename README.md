Hey, I'm Alex. Nice to meet you!

I am a new front-end developer. Previously I worked as a Mechanical Engineer for almost 7 years in different big companies and I wanted
to make a huge professional change.

I started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript a few months ago and also created my portfolio in React. I developed reusable
components, learned and used React Hooks, built a demo website and created mobile first layouts.

As a person, I can say I am creative and passionate about what I am doing, eager to learn and to evolve. I do photography as a hobby,
this way i can relax and inspire myself all the time. And in my spare time I love to play with my dog, play table tennis and go for bike
rides.

Here is a link to [my playground](https://alexandrumocanuc.github.io/playground/).
